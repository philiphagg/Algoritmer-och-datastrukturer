//TODO 6. Implement an ordered queue based on one of the implementations above. The elements stored in the queue should be integer values. The elements should be ordered at insertion so that all elements are stored in ascending order starting from when you insert the first element and in all following insertions. You should print the content of the list after each insertion/deletion of an element.
